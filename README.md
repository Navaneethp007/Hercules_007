# 1. Description of the project
   On an average almost 70% people who are missing are not found and out of that 30% people are missing because we make them missing. It is not only the fault of the  
   government but also our fault. People are not ready to help because the people who tried to help in the past were not appreciated in the right way. And if this continues
   people will have reduced social values towards each other, which in turn reduces social well being.
       
   The idea is to build an which allows people to help the government and maintain your privacy along with getting appreciated the right way. This also increases the
   moral trust in humanity.
   
# 2. Improvements Required
   This is just a static app and requires a lot of improvements like:
    -The api calling is not done.
    -The colour theme is not set.
    -The UI of pages needs to be improved.

   -After registering, you can a see a set of missions, each mission giving you information on a missing person.
   -If you find the person, then click "Report mission" to report and if you want to see other agents working on the same mission click the other button.
