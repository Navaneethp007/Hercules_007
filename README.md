# 1. Description of the project
   On an average almost 70% people who are missing are not found and out of that 30% people are missing because we make them missing. It is not only the fault of the government
   but also our fault. People are not ready to help because the people who tried to help in the past were not appreciated in the right way. And if this continues people will have
   reduced social values towards each other, which in turn reduces social well being.
       
   The idea is to build an which allows people to help the government and maintain your privacy along with getting appreciated the right way. This also increases the moral trust
   in humanity.
